# Landmines
A simple Content Warning mod that adds landmines to the game! They can spawn naturally or be bought & set.
## Types
- **Landmine**: The basic landmine. If pressure is put on it, it will explode as soon as the pressure is released.
  - If one of your friends steps on it, but they are carrying good footage, you can also step on it whilst they run back to the ship!
- **Impulse Landmine**: The impulse landmine is a landmine that will release a pulse of energy when stepped on, pushing away any players, items, or monsters in the area **at a great force**.
  - Larger than a normal landmine, but very hard to see!
